# Install pickle as an easier alternative to PECL, that is not
# available any more for PHP 8 and up. Some alternatives searched were:
#  - https://olvlvl.com/2019-06-docker-pecl-without-pecl
#  - https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/pickle
#  - manually "curl https://pecl.php.net/get/xxxx && tar && docker-php-ext-install xxx"
# Of course, if the images end using some alternative, we'll switch to it. Just right now
# there isn't such an alternative.a

# Update 20201126: Finally, see https://github.com/docker-library/php/issues/1087 it seems that pear/pecl
# continues being availbale with php8, so we are going to continue using it. The previous comments as
# left in case we need to find an alternative way to install PECL stuff and there isn't any official.
# For an example of php80-rc5 near complete, using pickle instead of pear/pecl, look to:
